# Basic-structures-tutorials
Manual implementation of basic structures (Tutorial-use)

- The purpose of this library is to provide an implementation of common basic structures in order to show the mechanisms behind.
  It is not meant to be used outside of tutorials/learning purposes (There are already existing implementations which are more complete and more efficient, especially in the standard library).
- The library lives in the namespace manual.
- To include the whole library, it is possible to include the all-in-one header manual.h.
  Moreover it provides some convenience typedef.
